**Quantum mechanics project**
I created an animation showing the time evolution of a wave function. 
Three cases were considered:
* Stationary state of arbitrary order in 2D infinite potential well ([2dwell.ipynb](2dwell.ipynb))
* Gaussian packet in 0 potential space ([2dwell_gauss.ipynb](2dwell_gauss.ipynb))
* Gaussian packet in 2D infinite potential well ([2dwell_bouncingGauss.ipynb](2dwell_bouncingGauss.ipynb))
